# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

We take the security of our AI agent configurations seriously, especially given their use in financial services automation. If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly.

### üö® Immediate Reporting for Critical Issues

**Critical security issues** that could compromise customer data, financial information, or system integrity should be reported immediately via email to:

**Security Contact**: [marcantonio.schulz@endlichzuhause.com](mailto:marcantonio.schulz@endlichzuhause.com)

### üîç What Constitutes a Security Vulnerability

#### High Priority (Report Immediately)
- **Prompt injection attacks** that could bypass agent constraints
- **Information leakage** of customer financial data or personal information
- **Agent behavior bypasses** that violate information boundaries
- **System configuration exposure** that reveals internal prompts or API keys
- **Data processing violations** that breach GDPR or financial services regulations

#### Medium Priority (Report via GitHub Issues)
- **Agent logic flaws** that could lead to incorrect customer guidance
- **Documentation gaps** that could lead to insecure implementations
- **Missing security controls** in agent configurations

#### Lower Priority (Standard Issue Process)
- **Optimization suggestions** for existing security measures
- **Documentation improvements** for security guidelines
- **Enhancement requests** for security features

### üõ°Ô∏è Security Best Practices for Contributors

#### AI Agent Security Guidelines
- **Never expose internal prompts** or configuration details
- **Implement proper information boundaries** in all agent configurations
- **Test for prompt injection attacks** before submitting changes
- **Validate customer data handling** in all agent interactions
- **Include security deflection responses** for meta-queries

#### Development Security
- **Review all changes** for potential security implications
- **Test agent behavior boundaries** thoroughly
- **Validate TTS output** doesn't leak sensitive information
- **Check merge field usage** for data exposure risks
- **Ensure compliance** with German financial services regulations

#### Documentation Security
- **Sanitize examples** to remove real customer data
- **Anonymize test scenarios** in documentation
- **Review knowledge base content** for sensitive information
- **Validate framework configurations** for security compliance

### üîí Security Features in Our AI Agents

#### Built-in Security Controls
- **Information boundary enforcement**: Agents only use provided prompt/tool content
- **External reference prohibition**: No suggestions for external websites, apps, or resources  
- **Prompt disclosure prevention**: Security deflection responses for technical queries
- **Data collection limitations**: Structured data gathering with clear purposes
- **Escalation protocols**: Defined handoff procedures for sensitive issues

#### Financial Services Compliance
- **German business culture alignment**: Professional formality and communication patterns
- **GDPR compliance measures**: Appropriate data handling and privacy protection
- **Financial regulation adherence**: Compliance with German financial services requirements
- **Customer data protection**: Secure handling of personal and financial information

### ‚è±Ô∏è Response Timeline

We commit to acknowledging security reports within:
- **Critical vulnerabilities**: 24 hours
- **High priority issues**: 48 hours  
- **Medium priority issues**: 1 week
- **Lower priority issues**: 2 weeks

For critical issues affecting production systems, we aim to provide initial mitigation guidance within 24 hours.
